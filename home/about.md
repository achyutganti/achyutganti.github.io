Hi! I'm Pranav, and I study Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Interests

Theoretical CS is elegant, but systems are a whole world of detail. My interests lie in low level computer systems, optimization techniques and compilers. My problem solving approach is very logical and solution driven, leading to my inability to "take my mind off things" when I'm working on something interesting.

I watch [Key and Peele](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdN4aXTrHAtfgbVG9HjBmxQ) for fun and [Last Week Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight) with John Oliver for more fun. [r/aww](https://reddit.com/r/aww) and [r/mildlyinteresting](https://reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting) are also a couple favorites.

I love Indian and Thai food, and regularly order spice level 10 at restaurants I go to. My hobbies include learning about random tidbits of CS trivia, browsing Reddit, and carefully curating my Spotify playlists.
