<p>There are many ways to install an image of the Linux OS on your drives. This tutorial shows just one of those many methods out there. Have Fun!! </p>

<p>Process:</p>
<!-- <style>
a:link {
    color: green;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  a:visited {
    color: pink;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: red;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  a:active {
    color: yellow;
    background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
  </style> -->

    <ol>
        <li>Click on <a href="https://gitlab.com/bztsrc/usbimager">this link</a> . This will take you to a place called USBimager.</li>
        <li>Pick your appropriate distribution and download the file onto your local machine. It is a pretty small file so it 
            shouldn’t take that long to install.</li>
        <li>Extract the files onto your disk</li>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu</a> and download the latest LTS version on your drive. But if you want to go with the non LTS-versions 
            that’s okay too. It means that you’ll enjoy the bleeding edge features of the latest updates to ubuntu but will 
            also come with the risk of bugs.</li>
        <li>Open USB imager on your PC and browse for the ubuntu file you have downloaded.</li>
        <li>Connect the USB flash drive to your computer and hit write.</li>
        <li>That’s it. Wait till the drive gets dedicated to the ubuntu image.</li>

    </ol>
</p>

<p>Enjoy the new OS!!</p>
